<h2 class="text-warning">HISTROY OF EIFFEL TOWER.......</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="text-primary">The Design of the Eiffel Tower:<br></h3>
<h5>The plan to build a tower 300 metres high was conceived as part of preparations for the World's Fair of 1889.
The wager was to "study the possibility of erecting an iron tower on the Champ-de-Mars with a square base, 125 metres across and 300 metres tall". Selected from among 107 projects, it was that of Gustave Eiffel, an entrepreneur, Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, both engineers, and Stephen Sauvestre, an architect, that was accepted.</h5>

<h5 class="text-warning">Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, the two chief engineers in Eiffel's company, had the idea for a very tall tower in June 1884. It was to be designed like a large pylon with four columns of lattice work girders, separated at the base and coming together at the top, and joined to each other by more metal girders at regular intervals.</h5>

<h5 class="text-dark">The tower project was a bold extension of this principle up to a height of 300 metres - equivalent to the symbolic figure of 1000 feet. On September 18 1884 Eiffel registered a patent "for a new configuration allowing the construction of metal supports and pylons capable of exceeding a height of 300 metres".</h5>

<h5 class="text-danger">In order to make the project more acceptable to public opinion, Nouguier and Koechlin commissioned the architect Stephen Sauvestre to work on the project's appearance.</h5>

<h2 class="text-success">Explanation (Theory) Of Eiffel Tower.....</h2>
<h5 class="text-dark">The Eiffel Tower's distinctive shape is based on physics. The tower's weight balances the maximum torque created by the wind</h5>
<h5 class="text-danger">The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel, a French civil engineer and architect. Construction began in 1887 and was completed in 1889. The tower was built to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution and to showcase France's industrial might.</h5>
