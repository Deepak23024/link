<h2 class="text-danger">HISTROY OF TAJ MAHAL....</h2>

<br>
<h5 class="text-info">The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.</h5>
<h5 class="text-warning"> The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</h5>

<h5 class="text-success">Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million).</h5>
<h5 class="text-muted"> The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</h5>

<h5 class="text-dark">The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history.</h5>
<h5> The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</h5>

<h2 class="text-danger">EXPLANATION (REASON) FOR BUILDING TAJ MAHAL.....</h2>
<br>
<h5 class="text-dark">The Taj Mahal is a symbol of love commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1632 to honor his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. 
 The story goes that the two met when they were 15 years old and fell in love at first sight.</h5> 
 <h5 class=:text-success">Jahan pursued Mumtaz for five years before marrying her in 1612. 
 Mumtaz was Shah Jahan's third wife and favorite. She died while giving birth to their 14th child.</h5> 
<h5 class="text-info">According to some, the historical record shows that the couple had a loving relationship. Mumtaz was Shah Jahan's best friend and counselor, and they were together for 20 years. During their marriage, Mumtaz gave birth to 14 children, but only eight survived.</h5>
